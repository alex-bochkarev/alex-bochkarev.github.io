    abstractNote={Recent studies employ collections of binary decision diagrams
                  (BDDs) to solve combinatorial optimization problems. This
                  paper focuses on the problem of optimally aligning two BDDs,
                  that is, transforming them to enforce a common order of
                  variables while keeping the total size of the diagrams as
                  small as possible. We address this problem, which is known to
                  be NP-hard, by introducing and studying a simplified problem
                  instead of working with the more complex original diagrams. We
                  discuss some basic properties of the simplified problem,
                  design a corresponding heuristic for the original problem, and
                  show empirically that this approach yields good quality
                  alignments while significantly reducing the complexity of
                  intermediate diagram transformations. We highlight the
                  practicality of this approach in the context of a variation of
                  the uncapacitated facility location problem. History: Accepted
