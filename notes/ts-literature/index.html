<li>Ref management is a part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal%5Finformation%5Fmanagement">PIM</a>: helps to capture,
search, manage, and use your collection of sources.</li>
<li>I use a system based on <a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a> as reference manager.</li>

<li>Another crucial part is integration with the editor. I use (pure) black magic
involving <a href="https://www.spacemacs.org/">(Space)Emacs</a> (<strong>not</strong> really beginner-friendly; there
are alternatives).</li>
<li>Keeping notes in a streamlined way is useful. There are several
approaches, and several classes of tools &ndash; see <a href="#software">A note on notes.</a></li>
<li>There are several ways to discover new literature, including proactive search
in search engines and specialized databases, as well as receiving updates

<h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
<p>Here I am discussing the system supporting my workflow, mentioning some of
alternative options. It may or may not work for you, of course, but hopefully
will provide some inputs to design your own IT &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo;. Here is a very
general (and therefore, useless by itself) description of the relevant
workflow:<br><br></p>
<figure><img src="/ox-hugo/process.svg"/>
</figure>

<p>This is a large topic, but roughly speaking the system<sup id="fnref:1"><a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1</a></sup> has three
key components:</p>
<ul>
<li>reference manager (works with bibliography data, such as <code>.bib</code> entries, along
with PDF files);</li>
<li>notes (that reflect your thinking process related to this paper/piece of
information),</li>
<li>editor integration(s) (that extracts the information from the other two as
you write your manuscript).</li>
</ul>
<p>It can be organized in <strong>many</strong> ways (including some good old paper-based versions
that were <a href="https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/download/2942475/2942530/jschmidt%5F2016%5Fniklas%20luhmanns%20card%20index.pdf">reported</a> to be&hellip; very productive, to say the least<sup id="fnref:2"><a href="#fn:2" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">2</a></sup>; a little
more on this below). I had the following specific <strong>requirements</strong> in mind:</p>
<ul>
<li>The system must be <strong>future-proof</strong>. Research is (hopefully) a long-term
endeavor, so lock-in with proprietary technologies is not acceptable. Storing
data in plain text is best, open standards and free software are my friends.
Oh yes, and I don&rsquo;t want to store my data in cloud all the time, I love tools
that work offline.</li>
<li>It must do the following things:
<ul>
<li><strong>capture</strong> a paper from a browser easily, retrieving bibliographical info
automatically when possible (including metadata extraction from PDFs).</li>
<li><strong>manage</strong> references efficiently (edit fields, etc.), categorize things, etc.</li>
<li>play well with <strong>LaTeX</strong> (mostly, looking for and inserting citations).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(something that I hope you will ignore:) a large benefit for me had anything
that worked well within <a href="https://xkcd.com/378/">Emacs</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The core component of such system is, of course, a (<em>bibliography-</em>,
<em>citation-</em>, or) <em>reference-manager</em>.</p>
<h2 id="on-references-and-bibliography">On references and bibliography</h2>
<h3 id="reference-managers">Reference managers</h3>
<p>A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference%5Fmanagement%5Fsoftware">reference-management</a> software is a tool that lets you to (surprise!) manage
references, i.e., bibliographical data: author, title, publisher data, etc.
That is, it captures and stores the bibliographical <em>data</em> in some internal
format (e.g., a <code>.bib</code> file, an <a href="https://sqlite.org">SQLite</a> database, etc.), and then can format it
as you&rsquo;d like: using the chosen <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Citation#Styles">citation style</a> and producing outputs in plain
text, word processor document, etc. It also usually helps to generate
bibliographies automatically, so that it updates as you edit the manuscript.</p>
<p>There are several key programs/services out there, and an infinite variety of
their comparative analyses:</p>
<ul>
<li>Wikipedia has pretty large <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison%5Fof%5Freference%5Fmanagement%5Fsoftware">comparison summary tables</a>. It might be a good
place to start, but the number of options is overwhelming.</li>
<li>Another detailed comparison was made in <a href="https://mediatum.ub.tum.de/doc/1320978/1320978.pdf">Technische UniversitÃ¤t MÃ¼nchen</a>.</li>
<li>University libraries usually have brief overviews of the software they
recommend: e.g., a nice one from <a href="https://ucsd.libguides.com/howtocite/compare">UCSD</a>, <a href="https://guides.lib.berkeley.edu/publichealth/citations">UC Berkeley</a>, <a href="https://guides.library.upenn.edu/citationmgmt">U. of Pennsylvania</a>.
Also: <a href="https://libguides.mit.edu/cite-write">MiT</a> (specifically on <a href="https://libguides.mit.edu/cite-write/citetools">citation management</a>), <a href="https://guides.library.harvard.edu/cite">Harvard</a>, <a href="https://library.stanford.edu/research/bibliography-management">Stanford</a>, <a href="https://guides.lib.uw.edu/research/citations/citation-tools">U. of
Washington</a>,</li>
<li>There are numerous Reddit discussions (such as: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LaTeX/comments/iouswl/jabref%5Fvs%5Fzotero%5Fvs%5Forgref%5Fwhich%5Fone%5Fdo%5Fyou/">JabRef vs Zotero vs org-ref</a>)</li>
<li>Of course, there is a paper <sup id="75f526c79b18bb5e78cde1133fd1c1f6"><a href="#ivey2018" title="Ivey \&amp; Crum, Choosing the {{Right Citation Management Tool}}: {{Endnote}}, {{Mendeley}}, {{Refworks}}, or {{Zotero}}, {Journal of the Medical Library Association : JMLA}, v(3), 399--403 (2018).">ivey2018</a></sup> on the topic<sup id="fnref:3"><a href="#fn:3" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">3</a></sup>.</li>
</ul>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong> it might be important what your colleagues are using. Using
the &ldquo;lab-default&rdquo; tools might make the choice very simple and efficient.</em></p>
<p>My personal short list would overlap with the Clemson Library&rsquo;s <a href="https://libraries.clemson.edu/research/citation-management/">one</a>
(at the time of writing this):</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.zotero.org/">Zotero</a>, <a href="https://www.jabref.org/">JabRef </a>- free options (first prio).</li>
<li>plus <a href="https://mendeley.com/">Mendeley</a>, <a href="https://refworks.proquest.com/researcher/">Refworks</a> (Clemson <a href="https://clemson.libguides.com/newrefworks">guide</a>), <a href="https://endnote.com/">EndNote</a> if I allow for commercial
products (I have also read some good things about <a href="https://www.papersapp.com/">Papers</a> for Mac &ndash; but
never had a chance to look myself).</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is not exhaustive, so please refer to more complete resources
(including the ones mentioned above) if you&rsquo;d need. Despite the problem seems
somewhat standard from the first sight, different people might want different
things, so there is no &ldquo;universal&rdquo; solution. Instead of trying to discuss pros
and cons, let me just try to sketch what works for me.</p>
<h3 id="my-zotero-based-system-dot">My Zotero-based system.</h3>
<p>Here is my system in a nutshell, from a technology perspective:</p>
<figure><img src="/ox-hugo/system.svg"/>
</figure>

<p>So, basically, I use the following tools:</p>
<ul>
<li>Zotero desktop app</li>
<li>Firefox plugin (<a href="https://www.zotero.org/download/connectors">&ldquo;Connector&rdquo;</a>) to fetch info from the web</li>
<li>Zotero addons (there is a larger <a href="https://www.zotero.org/support/plugins">list</a> of these):
<ul>
<li>BetterBibTex to make the <code>.bib</code> related magic happen;</li>
<li>LibreOffice integration (think MS Word);</li>
<li>ZotFile to be able to manipulate PDFs easily, including sending them to the tablet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, the &ldquo;manuscript&rdquo; part can be implemented, again, in several ways, and the
purpose here is to supercharge your editor to get info from the <code>.bib</code> file. My
<a href="https://www.spacemacs.org/">Emacs (Spacemacs)</a> handles this for me<sup id="fnref:4"><a href="#fn:4" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">4</a></sup>.</p>
<p>I have a convenient (fuzzy) search / auto-completion when I insert the keys:</p>
<figure><img src="/ox-hugo/org_insert_citation.gif"/>
</figure>

<p>And also I can easily pull out a PDF or my notes when I need to:</p>
<figure><img src="/ox-hugo/org_open_pdf_notes.gif"/>
</figure>

<p>For these rare cases when I use MS Word-like environments, there are
LibreOffice and Google Docs integration:</p>
<figure><img src="/ox-hugo/gdoc_insert_citation.gif"/>
</figure>

<p>(It is also worth noting that you can just find a paper in Zotero and copy a
citation in the necessary citation style, e.g., as a plain text &ndash; to insert it
anywhere.)</p>
<p>If you find it interesting, there are many demos and tutorials on Zotero on
YouTube and other places. Most probably, including a dedicated training in your
university library &ndash; at CU we have Clemson Libraries <a href="https://clemson.libcal.com/calendar/training?cid=3593&amp;t=d&amp;d=0000-00-00&amp;cal=3593&amp;inc=0">trainings/events</a>,
including <a href="https://clemson.libcal.com/event/7336551">&ldquo;Zotero for Citation Management&rdquo;</a>.</p>
<p>Finally, Emacs still feels very DIY-ish, to me. Good if you <em>like</em> to tinker with
it, but if I were to look for alternatives &ndash; I would start with other popular
&ldquo;mega-editors&rdquo;, such as <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VSCode</a> (<a href="https://vscodium.com/">-ium</a>) or <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a>. There must be plugins for this
(though, I have never tried these).</p>
<h3 id="a-word-on-latex-ecosystem-dot">A word on LaTeX ecosystem.</h3>
<p>I was somehow confused with the LaTeX-related systems, and found a relevant
<a href="https://tex.stackexchange.com/questions/25701/bibtex-vs-biber-and-biblatex-vs-natbib">TeX.StackExchange</a> question. In a nutshell:<br><br></p>
<figure><img src="/ox-hugo/latex.svg"/>
</figure>

<p>As far as I understand, one of the ideas behind <code>biblatex</code> was to move away from
a separate style definition language, <code>BST</code> (see also a <a href="http://tug.ctan.org/info/bibtex/tamethebeast/ttb%5Fen.pdf">manual</a> on BibTeX). While
the SE question mentioned above helped my understanding, but I believe this
topic is better suited for another day. Eventually, everything is determined by
the journal &ndash; style description format they provide.</p>
<h2 id="software">A note on notes.</h2>
<p>This is, actually, a separate topic. But if you feel the necessity to take
notes on your research in general (like an extended lab journal), there are
many options.</p>
<p>Basically, we are talking about a collection of interlinked notes. There are
several relevant &ldquo;keywords&rdquo; out there that I would like to mention.</p>
<ul>
<li>First, one might take a technological perspective and look for software that
allows to manage notes. This is, of course, good old Evernote<sup id="fnref:5"><a href="#fn:5" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">5</a></sup>,
and newer, free and open source <a href="https://joplinapp.org/">Joplin</a>.</li>
<li>There is a vast variety of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%5Fof%5Fwiki%5Fsoftware">wiki software</a> (such as <a href="https://www.dokuwiki.org/dokuwiki">DokuWiki</a> or <a href="https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/MediaWiki">MediaWiki</a>,
just to name a couple. But the list is huge.) Some of them are specifically
positioned as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Personal%5Fwiki">Personal Wiki</a> (e.g., such as <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/">TiddlyWiki</a> &ndash; see a nice 2.5
minutes <a href="https://tiddlywiki.com/#Introduction%20Video">intro video</a>).</li>
<li>There are specific solutions for working with an interconnected grid of
&ldquo;evergreen&rdquo; notes, the ones you might edit every time when you visit
them. I would like to mention:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://roamresearch.com/">Roam</a>. It looks totally exciting, but web-based (which
is a big no-go for me);</li>
<li><a href="https://obsidian.md/">Obsidian</a>. Comparable thing, uses local storage, as far as I can tell.
Ironically, I am not sure how good is it with citations/references ðŸ˜€.
Never used it at all, but to me, it looks <strong>very</strong> promising (especially if
it indeed keeps your information in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown">markdown</a>, which is essentially plain
text, so you can open it in future no matter what).</li>
<li><a href="https://www.orgroam.com/">Org-roam</a>. This is a part of <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/emacs/">Emacs</a> ecosystem over the all-mighty<sup id="fnref:6"><a href="#fn:6" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">6</a></sup>
<a href="https://orgmode.org/">orgmode</a>. Free and open source, local solution. This is what I use
currently.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Then, there is a specific <em>method</em> of taking such notes called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten">Zettelkasten</a>.
The word means a slip-box with notes. The idea is that after some time you
actually build such an &ldquo;external brain&rdquo; that conversations with it become
surprisingly productive (resulting in new connections and ideas). It can be
implemented with any reasonable tool. In fact, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas%5FLuhmann#Note-taking%5Fsystem%5F(Zettelkasten)">one</a> of the most famous
<em>ZettelkÃ¤sten</em> was implemented as a wooden box with drawers, filled with
small (paper) notes. It is worth noting: its author, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Niklas%5FLuhmann#Note-taking%5Fsystem%5F(Zettelkasten)">Niklas Luhmann</a>, was
doing Sociology, and this approach might (or might not) be less effective
for math-heavy fields. Anyways: It seems to be a vast topic, and there is a
lot of resources out there, if you are interested further, including<sup id="fnref:7"><a href="#fn:7" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">7</a></sup>:
<ul>
<li>ðŸ“– <strong>A book:</strong><a href="https://openlibrary.org/works/OL18635700W/How%5Fto%5FTake%5FSmart%5FNotes">&ldquo;How to Take Smart Notes&hellip;&quot;</a> by SÃ¶nke Ahrens.
Despite it has the sort of title I dislike very much, I found the book
pretty useful and informative<sup id="fnref:8"><a href="#fn:8" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">8</a></sup>.</li>
<li>ðŸ’¬ <strong>A community:</strong> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Zettelkasten/comments/b566a4/what%5Fis%5Fa%5Fzettelkasten/">r/Zettelkasten</a> on Reddit (the linked note includes couple of
good links on the subject; and there is a community <a href="https://zk.zettel.page/">wiki</a>, hosted
separately)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>On the contrary, someone from my friends just work on a relatively small
number of notes in <code>.tex</code> format (something like &ldquo;internal papers&rdquo; in his
lab).</li>
</ul>
<p>My system basically represents a graph of connected notes. It can even be
visualized like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/notes.png#full-shadow" alt="Notes graph"></p>
<p>Of course, I use it mostly from the text interface &ndash; imagine easily editable,
local Wikipedia. Also seems very useful to store code snippets &ndash; for saving
useful command line recipes, boilerplate <code>ggplot</code> code for figures, etc.</p>
<p><strong>As a concluding note:</strong> it seems to me that specific <em>tools</em> are not as important as
discipline, habits and procedures we set up for ourselves. Of course, a
lab notebook in one form or another is a must. I liked a point that came up in
one of private conversations recently, that <em>notes</em> is your product when you
are not working on a specific paper. And when you accumulate enough of them
&ndash; all this can &ldquo;graduate&rdquo; to a paper. Which is surprisingly along the
lines of what Dr. Luhmann was saying.</p>
<h2 id="discovering-the-literature">Discovering the literature</h2>
<p>I wanted to jot down a couple of words on <em>discovering</em> the
literature. Like, where do papers new can come from.</p>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> your library might provide a surprising amount of useful resources!
E.g., Clemson University Libraries offer <a href="https://libraries.clemson.edu/find/research-course-guides/">&ldquo;Research &amp; Course Guides&rdquo;</a> (with/
specific sections on <a href="https://clemson.libguides.com/IE">Industrial Engineering</a>, <a href="https://clemson.libguides.com/Mathematics">Mathematics</a>, and <a href="https://clemson.libguides.com/ComputerScience">Computer
Science</a>). I would like to thank our Librarian Jennifer Groff for a very
productive email conversation, which helped me a lot in preparing this
discussion. There might be more useful sources &ndash; check out the website!</p>
<h3 id="proactive-search">ðŸ”Ž Proactive search</h3>
<p>Who doesn&rsquo;t know about free search? Right, right&hellip; But still:</p>
<ul>
<li>Just Google search is (un)surprisingly good, sometimes.</li>
<li><a href="https://scholar.google.com">Google.Scholar</a> is handy when you are specifically looking for research
papers. (It also provides citation data along the way.) What is more
important: having a paper <code>X</code>, it allows to make more complicated requests,
e.g., find all the papers that cite <code>X</code>, find new papers by keywords among
those citing <code>X</code>, and such things.</li>
<li>There are specialized (commercial, usually subscription-based)
resources/databases to search for papers: the most general ones are,
perhaps, (Elsevier&rsquo;s) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scopus">Scopus</a> and (Clarivate&rsquo;s) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Web%5Fof%5FScience">Web of Science</a>. Also, there
is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MathSciNet">MathSciNet</a>, <a href="https://www.engineeringvillage.com/">EngineeringVillage</a>, etc. Of course, there is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List%5Fof%5Facademic%5Fdatabases%5Fand%5Fsearch%5Fengines">more</a> &ndash; these
are just random examples. I use these for more complicated searches, sometimes.</li>
<li>(surprise!) The University Library. For example, Clemson Libraries has
subscriptions to many databases, and allows to (1) search across these, and
(2) retrieve paywalled papers. So, I found this <a href="https://libraries.clemson.edu/">&ldquo;everything&rdquo; library search</a>
pretty useful. I think our CU library has access to more than <strong>500</strong>
databases; to give a random sample:
<ul>
<li><a href="https://methods.sagepub.com/">SAGE Research Methods</a></li>
<li><a href="https://credoreference.com">CREDO reference</a> (search in encyclopedias, dictionaries, etc.)</li>
<li><a href="https://about.proquest.com/libraries/academic/dissertations-theses/pqdtglobal.html">ProQuest Disserations and Theses Global</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>as a separate note: if you are a CU student, note that Clemson Libraries
provide trainings on what is out there and how to use it: e.g., see
<em>&ldquo;Introducing Library Research Strategies and Navigating the Clemson
Libraries&rdquo;</em> from <a href="https://grad360.sites.clemson.edu/index.php">Grad360</a> &ndash; seems to be scheduled for <span class="timestamp-wrapper"><span class="timestamp">[2021-01-29 Fri]</span></span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, that was <em>proactive</em> search. There are also more or less obvious methods
to receive papers, well, automatically. Apart from the obvious Twitter (or
whatever other social networks are used in your subfield&rsquo;s community) these
are feeds, mailing lists, and various seminars / events.</p>
<h3 id="feeds-rss-atom">ðŸ“° Feeds: RSS, atom</h3>
<p>The idea is that instead of checking relevant websites frequently yourself,
you delegate this task to the computer (we&rsquo;re engineers, after all, right?).
There is a web <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom%5F(Web%5Fstandard)">standard</a> for &ldquo;feeds&rdquo;, making websites machine readable &ndash; so
that a special program, feed <em>reader</em>, or a feed <em>aggregator</em> checks out the
websites that support such technology, and lets you know if a new paper /
blog post / web page on the site was published. As simple as that. A couple
of notes here:</p>
<ul>
<li>Speaking about software, I would mention Mozilla <a href="https://www.thunderbird.net">Thunderbird</a> or <a href="https://github.com/skeeto/elfeed">Elfeed</a> (if
you are into Emacs ecosystem) &ndash; this is what I tried to use, but I don&rsquo;t
really have an overview, so can&rsquo;t comment. Chances are, your default
desktop email client (if you happen to use it), or a browser (Safari?) also
can do that. Of course, there is a huge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison%5Fof%5Ffeed%5Faggregators">comparison table</a> on Wiki. There are
web solutions (e.g., <a href="https://feedly.com/">Feedly</a>), which I have no clue about. The colleagues
pointed out that Zotero can read feeds as well (so you could have
everything in one place).</li>
<li>Now, for this to work it must be supported by the <em>website</em>. There are some
solutions that try to circumvent this and try to build an RSS feed for you
(see <a href="https://feed43.com/">Feed43</a>)</li>
<li>Some journals provide RSS/Atom feeds: e.g., IJOC, EJOR, OPRE, etc.</li>
<li>Preprint servers might have feeds &ndash; e.g., arXiv <a href="https://arxiv.org/help/rss">mentions</a> subjects feeds,
updated daily. (unfortunately, to the best of my knowledge <a href="http://www.optimization-online.org/">Optimization
Online</a> does not do this).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="mailing-lists">ðŸ“¨ Mailing lists</h3>
<ul>
<li>Web of Science, Engineering Village, Google Scholar (and, perhaps, many
others) allow to set up citation alerts (e.g., weekly/monthly notifications
on your search results; alerts for new publications from a specific author,
etc.)</li>
<li>Some journals offer email subscriptions instead of feeds, sending out list
of papers, abstracts, etc. (e.g., Mathematical Programming)</li>
<li>There might be other mailing lists worth mentioning (seminars, departmental
lists, etc. &ndash; please let me know if you think I missed something worth
mentioning separately).</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="journal-clubs-seminars">ðŸ’¬ Journal clubs / seminars</h3>
<ul>
<li>Quite often there are efforts to read and share relevant papers in the
&ldquo;local&rdquo; community. I know at least one relatively large lab that systematically
keeps track of many relevant journals and present &ldquo;fresh&rdquo; papers during a
regular (internal) event.</li>
<li>There are also studies-focused reading clubs, aimed mostly not to keep
track of cutting-edge research, but to learn
<ul>
<li>how to do good science (essentially, pose and answer good research
questions, plan the research, etc.)</li>
<li>how to write good papers out of it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>We might want to make one, but this is a topic for another day.</li>
</ul>
